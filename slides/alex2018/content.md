## Contributions

--

* a novel and principled multi-task loss to simultaneously learn various classification and regression losses of varying quantities and units using **homoscedastic** task uncertainty
* a unified architecture for semantic segmentation, instance segmentation and depth regression

* demonstrating the importance of loss weighting in multi-task deep learning and how to obtain superior performance compared to equivalent separately trained models.
