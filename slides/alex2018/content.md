##  Motivation

- Scene understanding algorithms must understand both the geometry and
semantics of the scene at the same time.

- Combining all tasks into a single model reduces computation and allows these systems to run in real-time.

--

#### However

- Performance is highly dependent on an appropriate choice of weighting between each taskâ€™s loss

- Tuning these weights by hand is a difficult and expensive process, making multi-task learning prohibitive in practice.

---

## Research Goals

--

- A model trained under multi-task learning can outperform separate models trained individually on each task:
  * Sematic Segmentation
  * Instance Segmentation
  * Depth Estimation

---

## Contributions

--

* A novel and principled multi-task loss to simultaneously learn various classification and regression losses of varying quantities and units using *homoscedastic* task uncertainty

* A unified architecture for semantic segmentation, instance segmentation and depth regression

* Demonstrating the importance of loss weighting in multi-task deep learning and how to obtain superior performance compared to equivalent separately trained models.
